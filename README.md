## Features

- Interactive visualization of spring animations
- Real-time feedback on changes
- Supports parameter adjustments for customization

## Usage

To use the Spring Visualizer, simply input your initial spring parameters (such as stiffness, damping, mass) into the provided fields. The visualizer will then generate an interactive animation based on these parameters, and you are free to adjust them as you see fit. The changes will be reflected in the animation in real time, allowing you to fine-tune your settings for the perfect animation.

Spring Visualizer is an invaluable tool for those working with spring animations, providing an easy and efficient way to visualize and customise your animations.
